    <h1>what is git and github?</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple developers. GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional features like issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools.</p>

       <li><strong>Repository:</strong> A storage space where your project files and their history are stored.</li>
       <li><strong>Commit:</strong> A snapshot of changes made to the files in a repository.</li>
       <li><strong>Branch:</strong> A separate line of development that allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.</li>
       <li><strong>Merge:</strong> The process of integrating changes from one branch into another.</li>
